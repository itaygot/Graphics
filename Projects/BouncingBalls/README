Description:
	Simple game, simulating movement and collision of balls governed by a simplified 
	gravity and the user's ball/mouse drags.

	The program uses the OpenGL and FreeGlut libraries, and demonstrates basic
	usage of these libraries.

	The program also includes parts of helper library ('Common'), taken from Etay Meiri's
	tutorial - "http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/", that serves a back-end for the OpenGL
	library.

	Based on homework assignment at Hebrew University Computer Graphics course, 2013.

	Mouse click on the screen to create new bouncing balls.
	Drag existing balls.
